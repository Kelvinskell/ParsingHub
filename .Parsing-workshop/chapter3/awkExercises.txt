1) Get your mac address, print it by itself on a line.
  i.e. ifconfig | awk '{}'

2) Put your mac address in a variable named MACADDY
  hint, use tick marks '`' which is left of your 1 key on a mac.

3) Print the base 10 translation of MACADDY
  i.e. echo $MACADDY | awk '{}'

4) Get your most used commands.
  i.e. history | awk '{}' | sort -rn | head

5)Use awk to grep a file. Find the quote that starts /So please,/ and ends /lots of books/ in DahlWeb.txt -- Author https://www.hypable.com/best-roald-dahl-quotes/
  i.e. curl WEBSITE | awk '{/FIRST/,/LAST/}'

6) check for unread mail in your gmail inbox.  (google tends to block these commands, so do not worry if you need to skip this one)
  i.e. curl -u USERNAME --silent "https://mail.google.com/mail/feed/atom" | awk '{}'   #Note, dont put username:password, thats BAD, it will prompt you.

7) combine awk with last and uniq to get a list of persons who have used your computer, can you sort it based upon number of uses? what about print number of times used as well?

8) use awk to add 5 + 5 with the command echo "5+5" | awk '{}'
  Dont cheat and add spaces to your echo command, use the explicit command.

9) define two environment variables: HELLO="Hello" and WORLD="World", use them to print Hello, World! from awk WITHOUT using a pipe. 

10) Print all users in the /etc/passwd file

11) Perform any of the above commands using the -f flag for awk

12) Use awk to make a random number.
  hint: rand()

13) Use awk to define a hello world function, then print hello world with said function.
  This is probably best done in a .sh file as opposed to on the CmdLine

14) Read an article on X number of ways to use awk, try out some of the commands.  I suggest looking up one that affects your field, like 25 server administrator commands for awk or Awk for data scientists, or some other google search.

15) Look up RS, FS, OFS, ORS, NF, NR, FNR and FIELDWIDTHS in the manual.
