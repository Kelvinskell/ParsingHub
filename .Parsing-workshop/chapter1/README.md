# Chapter 1: Bash Fundamentals

To get us off the ground, we will review basic bash commands and concepts and practice them with a bunch of small exercises.
This introduction is by no means comprehensive - refer to our [additional resources](#additional-resources) for more information.


## A walk through basic Bash commands

We will get started with a quick review of some of the most important commands. We encourage you to test them out as you read through this your first time, but also use this as a cheat sheet later on.
Note that you can execute all examples given in this subsection to try them out.

### File operations
Let us get started with a bunch commands that allow you to work with files.
There is not too much to say about them, so we will keep descriptions short.
#### cp
- Syntax: `cp source destination`
- Description: Allows you to copy a file.
- Example: `cp example.txt other.txt` will create a copy of example.txt named other.txt in this folder.
- Notable Options:
  - `l`: links files instead of copies them
  - `n`: no file overwrites
  - `R`: recursive copy, includes hidden files
#### mv
- Syntax: `mv source destination`
- Description: Allows you to move a file.
- Example 1: `mv example.txt other.txt` move example.txt to other.txt in the same folder. Therefore, `mv` can be used to rename a file.
- Example 2: `mv example.txt ..` will move the file in the parent folder, but keep the name of the file.
#### touch
- Syntax: `touch file/directory`
- Description: Updates access date of file/directory as well as creates new files if `file` does not exist
- Example 1: `touch example.txt` will update the access date of `example.txt`
- Example 2: `touch test.txt` will create a file `test.txt`.


### File Examination
The following commands are used for examining files and are often used when parsing log files.
#### cat
- Syntax: `cat file1 file2 ...`
- Description: Reads files sequentially and writes them to standard output.
- Example: `cat example.txt other.txt` will print both `example.txt` and `other.txt` to the console.
#### more/less
- Syntax: `more file`, `less file`
- Description:
    - `more`: Allows you to  view a text file one page at a time. Press spacebar to go to the next page.
    - `less`: A much more advanced pager (>27000 lines of source code), allows you to walk through the file in pretty much any way you want.
- Example: Try `less example.txt`!
- Action item: Read this [article](https://www.lifewire.com/what-to-know-less-command-4051972).
#### head/tail
- Syntax: `less file`, `more file`
- Description: Reads files sequentially and writes them to standard output.
- Example: `cat example.txt other.txt` will print both `example.txt` and `other.txt` to the console.
#### wc
- Syntax: `wc file1 file2 ..`
- Description: `wc`, short for "word count," prints a count of newlines, words, and bytes for each input file.
- Example: `wc lines.txt`
- Notable Options:
  - `c`: prints the byte counts
  - `w`: prints the word counts
  - `l`: prints the newline counts
#### du
- Syntax: `du directory`
- Description: Outputs disk usage of directory.
- Example: `du .`
#### diff
- Syntax: `diff file1 file2`
- Description: Outputs differences of `file1` and `file2` line by line.
- Example: `diff lines.txt example.txt`


### Searching and Sorting
In order to quickly find relevant content in messy log files, searching and sorting is absolute key. The commands below will get us started, though we will also have to dive deeper into additional options (such as `awk` and `sed` later on).
#### grep
- Syntax: `grep pattern [file]`
- Description: Prints out every line in `file` that contains `pattern`. We will discuss how to define a pattern more under regular expressions.
- Example 1: `grep '1' lines.txt` will print out the two lines that contain `1`.
- Example 2: `grep '1' *` will print out the lines of any file in the current directory that contain `1`.
- Example 3: `grep '.' lines.txt` will print out all lines in `lines.txt` as they all match the pattern `.`.
- Notable Options:
  - `c`: This prints only a count of the lines that match a pattern
  - `i`: Ignores, case for matching
  - `v`: This prints out all the lines that do not matches the pattern
  - `f`: Takes patterns from file, one per line.
  - `w` : Match whole word
  - `o` : Print only the matched parts of a matching line,
#### fgrep
- Syntax: `grep string [file]`
- Description: Prints out every line in `file` that contains `string`. The main difference to `grep` is that it searches for a string rather than a pattern.
- Example 1: `fgrep '1' lines.txt` works just like the `grep` version.
- Example 2: `fgrep '.' lines.txt` will print nothing, unlike the `grep` version.
#### sort
- Syntax: `sort file`
- Description: Sorts the input file line by line and writes the result to standard output.
- Example 1: `sort lines.txt`. Read the output carefully, you might be surprised!
- Notable Options:
  - `o`: allows you to specify an output file.
  - `r`: sorts in reverse
  - `n`: sort files numerically
#### uniq
- Syntax: `uniq file`
- Description: Removes duplicate lines in text file.
- Example: `uniq lines.txt`. Does not change a thing! How about if you repeat the line `3` twice and then run it?
#### find
- Syntax: `find folder [options]`
- Description: Finds files in folder.
- Example 1: `find .`. 
- Example 2: `find . -name "example*"` Finds all files of the shape `example*`
- Example 3: `find . -size +1G` Finds all files over `1G` in size.
#### xargs
For the `xargs` command, we recommend first looking into the section about piping below, as it is hard to understand `xargs` without piping.
- Syntax: `xargs [command]`
- Description: xargs reads items from standard input as separated by blanks and executes a command once for each argument. The default command is to print it to standard output.
- Example 1: `ls -1 . | xargs` This prints out the content of the current folder in one line!
- Example 2: `echo 'one two three' | xargs mkdir` will create three folders in the current directory.


### Process Management
These commands are the most basic to get you started understanding what is running on a system.
#### ps
- Syntax: `ps`
- Description: Displays processes currently running (options allow you to toggle what kind of processes will be displayed.)
- Example: `ps`
- Notable Options:
  - `A`: List all processes
  - `au`: List all processes in BSD format
  - `fp`: Display process by process id (PID)
#### top
- Syntax: `top`
- Description: Live display or current processes with PID, %CPU and %Memory. You can quit the view  by typing `q`.
#### kill
- Syntax: `kill PID`
- Description: Kills the process with the given PID.

### Network
#### ssh
- Syntax: `ssh ip-address`
- Description: Attempts to establish an ssh connection to the given ip address.
- Notable Options:
  - `i`: Provide a private key for authentification.
  - `p`: Set port to connect to.
#### sftp
- Syntax: `sftp ip-address`
- Description: Stands for secure FTP. Uses the FTP protocol to transfer files. Starts an interactive session where you can transfer files between your machine and the ip address provided.
#### scp
- Syntax: `scp source destination`
- Description: Stands for secure copy. Allows you to copy files between servers using ssh and has the same options as ssh for authentification.
#### wget
- Syntax: `wget http://website.com/files/file.zip`
- Description: Allows you to download files, `wget` stands for web get.
#### curl
- Syntax: `curl website`
- Description: Allows you to download the content of a webpage, or really, anything accessible on the web. Supports a wide variety of protocols.
- Example: `curl google.com`

### Regular Expressions
Regular expressions are fundamental to efficient parsing. They allow you to define patterns that other tools, such as `grep`, `sed` or `awk` can use to process files.
Explaining regular expressions in detail is beyond the scope of this workshop and, fortunately, there are lots of good resources out there.
- [Action Item]: Read a [Brief Introduction to Regular Expressions](https://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/x17129.html)

#### Exercises:
- Define a regular expression that:
  - Matches `aad` and `aaad` but nothing else.
  - Matches any email address of the shape `something@somethingcom`.
  - Matches any IPv4 address.


### Shell Scripting
Let us get serious and learn how to write more complex and longer scripts!
To get started, we will review basic scripting constructs.
#### comments
A command line in a shell script starts with an `#`.
Example:
```
# I will be ignored
```
#### echo
- Syntax: `echo string`
- Description: Writes `string` to the standard output. Sends a newline at the end of the output.
- Example: `echo hello world`
#### printf
- Syntax: `printf string`
- Description: Writes `string` to the standard output. Does not send a newline at the end of the output.
- Example: `printf hello world`
#### read
- Syntax: `read variable_name(s)`
- Description: Assignes standard input to variable names.
- Example:
```
read var_name
echo "Your name is: $var_name"
```
#### let and (())
- Syntax: `let expression` or `((expression))`
- Description: Both `let` and `(())` evaluate and arithmetic expression.
- Example: `let "myvar = 5"; echo $myvar`
- Example: `((myvar = 5)); echo $myvar`
#### if
The classic if construct has the following syntax in Bash:
```
if [ "foo" = "foo" ]; then
  echo expression evaluated as true
fi
```
#### [ / test
- Syntax: `test expression` or `[ expression ]`
- Description: `test` evaluates the expression and, if it valuates to true,
     returns a zero exit status, otherwise it returns 1.
- [Action Item]: What is the difference between `[[ expression ]]` and `[ expression ]`?
#### seq
- Syntax: `seq number`
- Description: Writes the sequence `1..number` to standard output (separated by newlines).
- Example: `seq 3`
#### for/while
Let us explain the syntax of `for` and `while` loops with three examples.

The first loop bewlo loops through every element in the current working directory.

```
#!/bin/bash
for i in $( ls ); do
  echo item: $i
done
```
Recall that `seq 8` returns as list from 1 to 8. We can use this as a counter in a loop.
```
#!/bin/bash
for i in `seq 8`;
do
        echo $i
done    
```
For the last example, note that `lt` in a test block (`[]`) evaluates to less than.
```
#!/bin/bash
COUNTER=0
while [  $COUNTER -lt 5 ]; do
    echo The counter is $COUNTER
    let COUNTER=COUNTER+1
done
```
#### mapfile
- Syntax: `mapfile array`
- Description: Reads from standard input and outputs it into `array` as an array, where each row of standard input is its own element in the array.
- Notable Options:
  - `n`: set maximum number of lines to read
  - `s number`: Discard the first number of entries

## Variable Assignment
Variable assignment is simple and straightforward and no declaration is required before assignment:
```
STR="Hello World!"
```
is all it needs!

### Arrays
We have already used arrays in this workshop implicitly and their usage is pretty intuitive.
However, if you feel a little rusty, we recommend reading
[The Ultimate Bash Array Tutorial](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/06/bash-array-tutorial).

## Functions
There are two ways to define a Functions
```
function foo {
  echo "Hello World"
}
```
or
```
foo (){
  echo "Hello World"
}
```
Both versions are functionally equivalent. Note that the `()` is just do tell Bash that we are defining a funcion - you never actually write anything between the brackets (We will see below how to pass arguments to functions).

Go ahead and create file `first_function.sh` in this folder containing:
```
#!/bin/bash
# My First Function!
my_function () {
  echo "My first function!"
}

my_function
```
Let us now execute the script via
```
./first_function.sh
```
You should now see `My first function!` printed to the output.

### Passing Arguments

You can access arguments in your functions by using the variable placeholders `$1, $2, etc`. To try this out, write a script `passing_arguments.sh`
```
#!/bin/bash

print_my_argument() {
  echo $1
}

print_my_argument Hello
print_my_argument "Hello World"
print_my_argument Hello World
```
#### Exercise
- What happens when you run `print_my_argument` without any parameter?


### Return Values (or lack thereof)

Bash does not allow functions to send a return value. While this seems extremely limiting, you will notice that for most Bash's purposes, this is not a big issue. Bash does allow us to set a return status at the end.
The return status can be accessed via `$` after the function was run.

```
#!/bin/bash

return_status () {
  return 3
}

return_status
echo The return value was $
```
If we run this script, then the output will
```
The return value was 3
```
as this was the return code set by the function.

## Piping
One of the key concepts of Bash is piping, Bash's version of function composition. Piping is a very powerful concept to concatenate multiple commands.

The syntax for piping is as follows:
```
command1 | command2 | command3 | ...
```
This means that first, `command1` will be executed and its output is then *piped* to `command2` whose output is then piped to `command3` etc.

This is really best understood by looking at an example, let us run the following command:

```
ls -l | grep ".txt"
```
(Note that this is not the best way to do it, you should use `ls -l *.txt` instead).
What happened here: `ls -l` lists all files in the current directory. Rather than sending this to standard output, we send it to `grep ".txt"` which filters out all lines that do not contain `.txt` in them. The output of this will be sent to standard output.

It should be highlighted that commands in the pipeline (i.e. running between pipes) are being run in a subshell. This is important with regards to the scope of variables used within them.

### Redirecting the Output Stream

The `>` and `>>` can be used to redirect the output stream into a file.

- Syntax `command > file`
- Description: Redirects output of `command` to `file`. Overwrites content of `file` if it already exists
- Example: `echo hello < test.txt`

- Syntax `command >> file`
- Description: Redirects output of `command` to `file`. Appends content of `file` if it already exists.
- Example: `echo hello < test.txt`



### Exercises
- Write a short script that, given two text files, concatenates them and writes the output to a file `merged.txt` in the working directory.
- Given the files `lines.txt` in this directory, print out the 5th line using head and tail.
- Using `xargs` with the option `n`, finish the command `echo a b c d e f |` so that the output is: 
```
    a b
    c d
    e f
 ```
- Solve the following [10th Line](https://leetcode.com/problems/tenth-line/) exercise on Leetcode! Why does a simple solution based on `head` and `tail` not work?
  - Hint: One approach is to look at `mapfile` carefully.
- What does the following code snippet do?

```bash
while read -r line || [[ -n "$line" ]]; do
    echo $line
done < "$1"
```
  - Take some time to dissect this code snippet, it can be quite useful when you want to work on a specific file on a line by line basis (by replacing the `echo $line` with something useful).
  - Note that in chapter 3, you will learn `awk` and `sed` which are often the better choice over a custom loop.
