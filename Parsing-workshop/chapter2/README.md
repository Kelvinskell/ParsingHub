# Chapter 2: Python Fundamentals

This chapter will review basic data structures in Python as well as some standard commands/modules useful for log parsing. The reader is expected to have a basic familiarity with Python.
This introduction is by no means comprehensive - refer to our [additional resources](#additional-resources) for more information.

## Data structures
A very brief overview over essential data structures in Python.  
### Variables
As Python is an untyped scripting language, variable assignments are as simple as can be.

```Python
a = "hello"
print(a)
a = [1, 2, 3]
print(a)
```


### Comments
Comments are an essential part of good software engineering practices. especially for complex code.
In Python, comments are started with `#`:

```Python
# I am a comment
#Please do not this, there should always be a whitespace after #
```
### Lists
A list is Python's version of an array. It is important to be familiar with lists and the methods the standard library provides. Here is a quick rundown:
```Python
a = [2, 1, 3]
print(a.sort()) # [1, 2, 3]
a.append(3)
print(a) # [1, 2, 3, 3]
a.extend([-9, 8])
print(a) # [1, 2, 3, 3, -9, 8]
a.remove(1)
print(a) # [2, 3, 3, -9, 8]
print(a[-1]) # [8]
print(a[2:4]) # [3, -9]
print(max(a)) # 8
print(a.count(3)) # 2
```
### Strings
Similar to lists, strings come with a bunch of handy built in functions. Let us again review them by example:
```Python
a = 'i am a string with a couple of words'
print(a.count('str')) # 1 because it counts occurences of 'str'
print(a.capitalize()) # I am a string with a couple of words
print(a.endswith('words')) # True
print(a.isalpha()) # True
print(a.isdigit()) # False, as a contains non-digit characters.
print(a.upper()) # 'I AM A STRING WITH A COUPLE OF WORDS'
print(a.split(' ')) # ['i', 'am', 'a', 'string', 'with', 'a', 'couple', 'of', 'words']

```
A couple of other useful functions to review:
- `.format()`: Allows you to reformat strings nicely.
- `sorted()`: Sorts strings alphanumerically.
### Dictionaries
Dictionaries are Python's version of hash maps. They are very easy to define and use:
```Python
d = {'key': 'value'}
print(a['key']) # value
```
Here are a couple of methods to review:
```Python
d = {'A': 'Z', 'B': 'Y'}
print(d.items()) # [('A', 'Z'), ('B', 'Y')]
print(d.keys()) # ['A', 'B']
print(d.values()) # ['Z', 'Y']
print(sorted(d.items(), key=lambda i:i[1])) # [('B', 'Y'), ('A', 'Z')]

```
### Regular Expressions
Just like in Bash, regular expressions are incredibly important for parsing.
If you have reviewed the resource provided in chapter 1 on regular expressions, you should not struggle with regular expressions in Python as well.
However, the documentation of the `re` module is crucial to at least read once.

- [Action Item] Read [Doc of re module](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html)


#### Exercises
-  Write a Python program to check that a string contains alphabetical characters using `re` and not the built in `isalpha()` method.
- Write a Python program that matches a string that has a `g` followed by zero or more `r`s.
- Write a Python program that matches a string that has an `ac` followed by one or more `b`s and then at least one `q` after the last `b`.


## Working with Files
The functionality to work with files in Python is part of its `io` module that is always loaded and need not be imported.
A simple way to open a file is via
```Python
try:
    my_file_handle=open("example.txt")
except IOError:
    print("File not found or path is incorrect")
finally:
    print("exit")
```
(Note that it is better handle the error by printing a more concrete error message)
Some methods to read a file:
- `my_file_handle.read(n)`: Reads the first `n` bytes of  the file
- `my_file_handle.read()`: Reads the entire file
- `my_file_handle.readline()`: Reads one line of the file
- `for line in my_file_handle:` loops through the file line by line
- `my_file_handle.close()`: closes the file
## Argument Parsing
When using command line arguments, it is important to parse them in a robust way. In Python, your module of choice is given by `argparse`. Using argparse you can define what arguments you require and what type they have.

Make sure that you:
- Have a self-contained function that takes in passed arguments and validates them before executing your code
- Generate help and usage message for the user
- Have meaningful error messages when the arguments given do not match the signature

- [Action Item]: Read the excellent [documention of argparse](https://docs.python.org/3.7/howto/argparse.html) (contains lots of examples).

## Other Important Modules
Here is a short list of additional modules that are useful for parsing and working with logs. We will revisit some of them in later chapters.
- [Beautiful Soup for HTML parsing](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)
- You can also generate your own parsers! We might add more material on this in subsequent chapters, but the curious can learn more [here](https://tomassetti.me/parsing-in-python/#parserGenerators)

- [Log File Parsing in Python](https://pythonicways.wordpress.com/2016/12/20/log-file-parsing-in-python/)
## Exercises
All exercises are based on `example.txt` in this file.
- Write a Python script that counts the number of alphabetical words in `example.txt`.
- Write a Python script that returns the sum of all integers contained in `example.txt`.
- Write a Python string that, given a string, prints all lines in `example.txt` that contain the given string.
