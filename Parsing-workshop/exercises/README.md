# Exercises for the Parsing Workshop

While the individual chapters contain their own little exercises, a collection of more involved exercises together with test data to try them out is linked here.

Many of the exercises are already linked to in the individual chapters and we encourage you to solve them as you work through the chapters.

The intended way of solving the exercises is by adding your **Python and Bash** scripts to the corresponding folders.
This will also allow you to easily do code reviews on each other's solutions.
