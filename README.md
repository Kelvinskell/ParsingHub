# ParsingHub
Hello :wave: and Welcome to ParsingHub. 

This repository contains implementations of Python and Bash solutions to different parsing challenges faced by DevOps Engineers and System Administrators.

The idea for this project was developed after working through 
[Insight's](https://www.insightdevops.com) **Parsing-Workshop**.

**ParsingHub** is basically a collection of my own solutions to the excersices found in the [Parsing-Workshop](https://github.com/InsightDataScience/Parsing-Workshop).

## How To Walk Through
There are five chapters in this hub, corresponding with the chapters in the [Parsing-Workshop](https://github.com/InsightDataScience/Parsing-Workshop).
The Parsing-Workshop repository has been included as a subtree in this project for easy reference. 

Each chapter contains Python and/or Bash solutions to the exercises in the Parsing-Workshop, together with any necessary test-data. 
All of my solutions have been tested on at least two Linux distributions, so it is guaranteed to work on your own Linux system. 
While I did not test the solutions on a Windows machine, given the platform-independent nature of Python, the python solutions will work as expected on Windows. 
The bash solutions will probably work for Windows users who use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). 


For any of my DevOps Fellows or any System Administrator working through this Hub, I earnestly hope that the solutions herein will solve some of your technical problems - or at least give you a starting point. 

Do not hesitate to submit a pull request if you wish to contribute or if you want to report an issue.
